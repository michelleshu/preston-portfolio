        We learn to speak and learn the white myth,

        and realize we don’t have a place in that.

      <Text className="TileText">
        Then we are told: if we do this, we could.

      <Text className="TileText">If we do that, it’s true.</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">That’s a myth about the myth.</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">It’s not ours.</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">It’s sad if that is all we have.</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        We actually aren’t talked about as if we are less than.
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">The white myth is a privilege.</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        Just because we have privilege doesn’t mean that we are less than.

        But if you are a person with privilege—it means they are less than.

        Just because I am not part of the white myth doesn’t mean you are less
        than.
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">That’s the myth part of it.</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        We keep trying to adopt this myth and make it our own.

      <Text className="TileText">It’s not.</Text>

        We need a way to talk that is not limited by a myth that excludes us.
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">It excludes us without saying that.</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        It excludes us but tries to tone us down.
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        But we are part of the white myth because we are trying to make it
        theirs.

      <Text className="TileText">I got my own.</Text>
