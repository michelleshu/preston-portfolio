        The problem is, let’s talk about a common basic theme or concept:
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        treat people the way you want to be treated,
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        love God and love thy neighbor as thyself.
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">That’s the sum of everything.</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        If you believe that, the results are reaffirming.
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        Regardless of how I’m treated, the integrity is there.
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">There is an integrity with myth-making,</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        even if it’s made up or stories passed down.
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        That’s the thing that resonates with people
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        it seems to make sense on a level you don’t have to explain.
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        It becomes: “Ahhh, that’s right. That’s just how things are.”
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        Then when something challenges that: do you add to the myth?
      </Text>
      <Text className="TileText">Do you question it?</Text>
      <Text className="TileText">
        How does mythology handle things that are different than what you think?
      </Text>
    </Box>
