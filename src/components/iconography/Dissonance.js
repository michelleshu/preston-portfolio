      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        In symbolic and mythic frameworks, dissonance is a state of inner
        misalignment where one's actions, thoughts, or emotions conflict with
        internal values, beliefs, or desires. It is a form of energetic
        turbulence, not inherently negative, but destabilizing, often signaling
        transformation, inner conflict, or spiritual fragmentation. Dissonance
        may manifest as emotional distress, numbness, identity crisis, or
        existential questioning.

        In your mythos, dissonance is a current of interruption, a necessary
        disruption that reveals distortion, repression, or displacement within
        the self. It serves as both warning and invitation: to realign, to
        question inherited frameworks, or to shed outdated identities.

      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        While often pathologized in psychological or religious discourse,
        dissonance in this system is not sin or failure, but an interruption of
        resonance that offers the potential for deeper integration.

      <Text className="IconographyTextDarkBold">Philosophical Note:</Text>
      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        Dissonance is not inherently bad, it is often the precursor to
        revelation, change, or awakening. It reflects the layered and
        contradictory nature of being human, especially within rigid social or
        moral systems. In my system, dissonance is sacred, a spiritual signal
        that something within the self is trying to be heard or restored.
