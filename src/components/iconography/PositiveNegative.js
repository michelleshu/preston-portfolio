        Polarity to me is a current, an energetic force that shapes every story,
        every symbol, every self. They shape how we exist, how we process

        Positive and Negative are not good and evil, light and dark, right and

        interpretation of positive and negative. They aren’t moral terms, truly.
        They are movements. Frequencies, I would call them. They are the scales
        by which the Infinity Planes abide.

        We are trained socially, morally, and religiously to see positivity as

        In psychology, positive thinking means hope and potential; negative

        In spirituality, positive energy is alignment; negative energy is

      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>

        In ontology, “positive” is defined by presence. “Negative” is defined by
        absence.

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Ontology (the study of what is): something is “positive” if it exists,
        if it’s present, if it has form. “Negative” refers to what’s absent,
        what’s missing, or what’s defined by what it is not.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        But absence isn’t useless. It creates desire, curiosity, hunger.

        Think: We want what we don’t have. We reach for the unknown.

        In logic and language, negation (the “not”) helps us understand meaning.

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        “He’s not awake” still tells us something important.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        “Unseen” still implies there’s something to be seen.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        So: absence isn’t void. Consider it to be tension. It’s potential.

        The Infinity Planes work with energy that moves between what is and what

        These are all things defined partly by absence, by the void, by what is
        missing, lost, imagined, or even distorted.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        I’ve been influenced by philosophical thinkers like Hegel, Marcuse, and
        Derrida because they challenge binaries.

      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Hegel’s positive dialectics build on the current idea.

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Negative dialectics break the frame and go beyond it.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Marcuse warns us about “one-dimensional thinking” the kind that just
        repeats what already exists.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Derrida shows that binaries like positive/negative aren’t natural
        they’re built.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        And the “positive” side only makes sense because the “negative” is
        holding it up in the background.

      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>

        How?
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        By thinking in layers, contradictions, and paradoxes not just
        black/white, good/bad.

      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        That’s linked to the Negative current not because it’s bad, but because
        it interrupts the dominant structure.

        “Multidimensional thought” is myth-making, dreaming, emotional truth,

        It’s not limited to logic or surface appearances.

      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        That’s why it connects to myth and dreams.
      </Text>

        Because myth reshapes reality and challenges what we think we know.

        In my dreams, as Altensien Skybreaker, I have witnessed an existence
