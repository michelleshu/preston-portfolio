        The metaphor is this:
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        My dream path follows the formation of a star.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        I believe humans are all connected; through time, space, energy, dreams,
        and the void. That we came from stars themselves. That to explore
        creation, I need to follow the birth of a star.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Stars are real. They exist. People say God exists too. And if a god
        exists, then other existences can’t be denied. That’s why so much is
        theory and not fact, because the possibility that something could be
        true is what gives it power.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        We don’t know.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        And in not knowing… we do know.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        We know we can’t deny another person’s belief. But belief is full of
        contradiction. One person’s immoral is another person’s moral. These are
        human laws. And human laws shift. They can be rewritten, consciously,
        subconsciously, spiritually. That’s what gives birth to theory, concept,
        belief, system, narrative.

        So what does my work say metaphorically about how I view my identity?
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        It says: I want to express my experience creatively, outside the
        narratives that were placed on me by a society obsessed with boxes.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>

        Let’s go outside the box, while still being in the box.

        Let’s bend it. Warp it. Dream through it.

        I can express how it feels to live in this world my way.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        I can construct a world and a reality that I’ve dreamed about,
        fantasized about, believed in. And why couldn’t it exist? Why couldn’t
        it matter?

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        By being a Black artist, the art I make is inherently Black. It speaks
        to what it means to live in a body like mine. I speak on identity in a
        way that breathes life into it, not as a label but as a force. If I
        shape a universe with my own rules, beliefs, and construction and others
        find a way into it; could it
      </Text>
      change how they see the world?
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Isn’t that what art is?
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        To inspire. To provoke.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        To create something open enough for others to step inside, but specific
        enough that they know you made it.

        I won’t lie, maybe I do enjoy the idea of playing god.

        But I’d never want to be one.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        I just fantasize about the act of creating.

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        And really, there is no god without humans.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Maybe god was lonely and needed us.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Because gods only exist because we dreamed of them.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        And I want to give birth to a world defined by me, my experiences, my
        dreams, my biases, my influences. All of it. All that shaped me into who
        I am. I want to build something real. Authentic.

      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        I envy the ancestors who came before me.

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        They created beliefs that led entire generations down paths.

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        That’s power.

        I believe religion is one of the most powerful forces in existence.

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        It shapes perception. Identity. Imagination.

      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        So why wouldn’t I want to create my own?

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Maybe that sounds like ego. Maybe some will call it hubris.

        But if I want to build something that shapes, mends, molds, inspires,
