      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        A nightmare is a dream form characterized not by its content, but by its
        emotional frequency, specifically fear, disruption, or energetic
        dissonance. Within my system, nightmares are not “bad dreams” but
        symbolic confrontations. They arise from imbalance, trauma, or
        distortion, and offer the dreamer access to truths that are hidden,
        repressed, or unintegrated.

        Nightmares do not oppose dreams; they are dreams seen through the
        current of disruption. They are necessary agents of mythic
        transformation, working within the law of balance, not morality. To
        experience a nightmare is to undergo psychic tension, often producing
        fear, confusion, or grief, but that tension may generate awakening,
        reintegration, or creative fire.

      <Text className="IconographyTextDarkBold">Philosophical Notes:</Text>
      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        Nightmares are not lesser than dreams, they are initiatory. They disrupt
        only to reinvent. What they disturb is often what needs examination.
        What they withhold is often what must be pursued. In the dream-logic of
        the Infinity Planes, nightmares are signals of spiritual density and
        narrative weight.
