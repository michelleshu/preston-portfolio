      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        In symbolic and metaphysical frameworks, a dream is a trans-dimensional
        state of perception in which archetypal meaning, memory, and emotional
        frequency converge. Dreams are not reducible to imagination or neural
        activity; they are portals, active states of consciousness where
        identity shifts, time folds, and inner truths surface. In your system,
        dreams function as overlays upon archetypes, altering perception,
        revealing hidden structure, and opening pathways to the Infinity Planes,
        alternate realms governed by spiritual and emotional frequency.

        Dreams are neither illusions nor escapism; they are narrative wells,
        emotional and energetic mirrors where one can witness, embody, or
        traverse new truths, identities, or versions of reality.

      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        Dreams do not obey the physical laws of the waking world. Instead, they
        operate within laws of spiritual frequency, symbolic resonance, and
        archetypal alignment. They serve as portals, ritual tools, and narrative
        transmissions that expand the limits of self-knowledge and reality.
