        I believe we are all under the rule of polarity that everything exists
        within a frame of balance. A scale that holds the weight of positive and
        negative. But these do not mean good or bad.
      </Text>
      <div className="IconographyBreak"></div>
      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        Because as human beings, with all the complexity and multiplicity that
        comes with being human, our sense of positive and negative is never the
        same. We feel them differently. They align differently. They shift. So
        how does one navigate the world and their own existence? I believe that
        individuals shape their existences through their beliefs, almost
        innately, maybe?

      <Text as="p" className="IconographyParagraph">
        The concept of good or evil, in my opinion, was too much for humans to
        bear. Morality shifts depending on perspective. What makes one person
        more than another? Who decided that blood carries power? That someone
        descended from gods? Does that knowledge make you worth more? That
        wealth separates us? That your god is more real than the god of someone
        beneath you? That your religion is law, that it is fact? The power of
        dreams, of mythology, of beliefs is indeed powerful.

        But because we are human, it is hard to see where we all come from.
        Equally human is a broad and abstract idea but everyone has a different
        idea of what makes us human. This, by definition, is an inequality. No
        two people define humanity the exact same way. Inherently we are all
        humans but not any of us are the same. We experience things so
        differently and that is what makes being a human fascinating but that
        also gives birth to inequalities.
