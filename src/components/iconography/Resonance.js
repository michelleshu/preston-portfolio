      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        In mythic and symbolic systems, resonance refers to an internal state of
        energetic coherence, where thoughts, emotions, and actions are in
        alignment with one’s core self or spiritual center. It is not a moral
        achievement but a frequency of attunement, often experienced as clarity,
        harmony, presence, or flow. Resonance indicates congruence between the
        internal world and the external reality or mythic field one inhabits.

        In dream-based metaphysics, resonance reflects a moment of vibrational
        truth: when the self, its desires, and its direction feel unified. It is
        a felt-sense of rightness, not in the moral sense, but in the
        ontological sense of fittingness.

      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        Resonance is not static bliss, it can include intensity, grief, or
        transformation, but it is recognizable by a lack of resistance within
        the self. It may be subtle (a gut knowing) or profound (a cosmic
        connection), but it always reflects a deep form of spiritual or
        emotional alignment.

      <Text className="IconographyTextDarkBold">Philosophical Note:</Text>
      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        Not to be confused with “positivity.” Resonance may occur in dark or
        painful moments if the experience is congruent with the self’s truth.
        Often associated with integration, growth, spiritual awareness, and
        emotional clarity. In my system, it belongs to the Heart Current, a
        non-moral spiritual signal of coherence and direction.
