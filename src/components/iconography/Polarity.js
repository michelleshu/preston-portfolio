      <Text className="IconographyTextDark">
        In mythic-philosophical systems, polarity refers to the fundamental
        energetic current that shapes perception, emotion, transformation, and
        creation. It is not a moral dichotomy but a dynamic tension between
        complementary forces, typically labeled positive and negative, that
        co-construct reality through interplay, movement, and change. In
        dream-based frameworks such as the Infinity Planes, polarity is
        understood as a spectrum of presence and absence, stabilization and
        disruption, construction and deconstruction. It is neither good nor
        evil, but a structuring principle embedded in all forms of existence,
        expression, and narrative.

        Rather than being fixed opposites, the polar currents form a generative
        field in which identity, myth, and meaning are shaped and reshaped. As
        such, polarity serves as both compass and catalyst within
        multidimensional thought systems.
