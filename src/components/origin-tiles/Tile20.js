        Black folks as a whole understand that the white myth is really good.

        maybe allowing Black folks to be educated, allowing them into certain

        If it hurts others, that’s the price of keeping the myth going.

        The more you create, the less you have to explain.

        My overexplaining is a result of my response to the myth.
